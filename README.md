# eCommerce-Backend

## Description

In this challenge, I modified starter code to build the back end for an e-commerce site by configuring a working Express.js API that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The app displays the creation of the mySQL database with models and associations. The API Routes perform RESTful CRUD operations as demonstrated in the preview video.
